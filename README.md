# 🏥 Healthcare Cost Analysis & Optimization  

## 📌 Overview  
This project analyzes healthcare cost data to identify key factors influencing medical expenses and builds predictive models to optimize cost estimation. Insights help patients, providers, and insurers reduce costs and improve policies.  

---

## 📊 Objectives  
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on healthcare cost data.  
- Identify key cost drivers such as **age, BMI, smoking, and region**.  
- Build predictive models for healthcare charges.  
- Compare performance of **Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost**.  
- Provide actionable recommendations for cost reduction.  

---

## ⚙️ Methodology  
1. **Data Preprocessing** – Handle missing values, encode categorical features.  
2. **EDA** – Correlation heatmaps, distribution plots, and trend analysis.  
3. **Modeling** – Train/test split, regression models, hyperparameter tuning.  
4. **Evaluation** – Metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R².  
5. **Optimization** – Identify controllable cost drivers (e.g., smoking, BMI).

## 📈 Results  
- **BMI** and **smoking** have the largest impact on healthcare charges.  
- **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** outperform Linear Regression in predictive accuracy.  
- Insights suggest **preventive health measures** can significantly reduce costs.  

---

## 📌 Key Insights  
- Smoking increases healthcare costs drastically.  
- Higher BMI correlates with increased medical charges.  
- Regional differences highlight policy-driven variations.  
- Predictive modeling can support **insurance pricing and healthcare planning**.
